Our Resource Calculator for example requires you to fill in an integer instead of '12 {units.first_unit_name} and 2 {units.second_unit_name}'. By using this tool, you can quickly convert these {units.first_unit_name} into integers."

In a regular calculator it will cost you 2 steps to convert a number to {units.first_unit_name}, but a {tool_name} will calculate this all at once, which makes converting large amounts of different units less painful."
