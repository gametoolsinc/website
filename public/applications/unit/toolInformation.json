You can then calculate the number of {units.second_unit_name} remaining by subtracting the number of {units.first_unit_name} multiplied by 64 from the total number of {units.second_unit_name}. If you follow these steps, you can easily calculate how many {units.first_unit_name} a given number of {units.second_unit_name} is."

It can often be hard to wrap your head around all the different units, it's therefore useful to have a simple calculator which calculates between these units. Our Resource Calculator for example requires you to fill in an integer instead of '12 {units.first_unit_name} and 2 {units.second_unit_name}'. By using this tool, you can quickly convert these {units.first_unit_name} into integers."

                "text": "If you would just divide a number by 64 you would often end up with a decimal number. This will give you an idea of the amount of {units.first_unit_name}, but nothing about the amount of {units.second_unit_name} left over. In a regular calculator it will cost you 2 steps to convert a number to {units.first_unit_name}, but a {tool_name} will calculate this all at once, which makes converting large amounts of different units less painful."
